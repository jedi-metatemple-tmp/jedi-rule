<title>On the Decent Conduct that is Required of All Jedi</title>


<lcn>

<p>
It is imperative on every Jedi to exercise responsible
stewardship of their sense of humor.
Laughter can be a powerful medicine on many levels
- yet used irresponsibly, it can be a source of
great harm as well.
</p>

<p>
A Jedi must therefore be mindful of how their jokes
affect others and how they affect society at-large.
The fact that a joke seems funny, even hilarious
to the unrefined mind
does not excuse a Jedi to perpetuate that
joke if that joke causes harm -
whether that harm is in the form of
belittling another's concerns,
perpetuating false and potentially damaging
perceptions of a person or group,
or in general dehumanizing them.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, whenever you hear, read, or
otherwise receive a joke that would cause
such harm -- first and foremost you must
not pass that joke on to others - but rather,
make your receiving of the joke into a dead-end
to it's propagation.
That you must do at the very least.
If possible, make objection to such hurtful
humor known - and do this calmly, yet clearly.
</p>

<p>
The next step after this is to train yourself
to no longer even see such hurtfulness as
funny.
For starters, this will be progress to
refining your mind into the more clear-thinking
mind that is appropriate for a Jedi.
However, as an added benefit,
it will make it much easier to avoid uttering
a laugh or doing something else that would
cause you to be sending mixed signals when
you fulfill your obligation to express your
objection to the inappropriate joke.
