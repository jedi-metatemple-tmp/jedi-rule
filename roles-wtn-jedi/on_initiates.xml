An <vc>Initiate</vc> is a Jedi in the earliest formal
stage of training.
In the ideal setting, where Jedi start their training
at very young ages, Initiates tend to be children,
in which case they are often referred to as "Younglings".
</p>

<p>
An Initiate trains in the Jedi discipline in the
most sheltered context that their school has
the practical ability to provide.
It is as an Initiate that one learns the basics
of the Jedi Discipline.
This includes, but is not limited to, learning
how to construct the tools that Jedi of that
school are expected to know how to construct.
