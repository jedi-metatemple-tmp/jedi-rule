<p>
Early in the Padawan phase of a Jedi's training, zir
Mentor will keep zim on a very tight leash, supervising
very closely everything zie does.
As time goes by, however, and the Padawan demonstrates
greater levels of competence, this level of supervision
will decrease - and the leash will lengthen.

<p>
And eventually, after the Padawan has passed all the
necessary trials,
zie will continue zir Jedi training, no longer as zir
Mentor's pupil, but as a <i>peer</i> to zir former mentor.
It is at this point that the Jedi graduates from the Padawan
phase of zir training and becomes a <vc>Knight</vc>.
