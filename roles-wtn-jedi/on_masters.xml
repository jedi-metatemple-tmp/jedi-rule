<p>
A <vc>Master</vc> is a Knight who has
demonstrated effectiveness not just
at living the Jedi Code and practicing
the Jedi Arts in the field, but at
training others in the Jedi way.
One way that a Jedi may do this is by
training a Padawan to the point of
Knighthood.

<p>
Many think that the term "Master" is for
one who has reached a certain level of
perfection in their Jedi training.
This is not correct. The hypothetical
one who has attained perfection in the
Way is a <vc>Sage</vc> - and Sagehood
is an asymptotal goal that all Jedi, whether
they be Initiates, Padawans, Knights, or
Masters must all move <i>toward</i> -- but
which none will actually <i>reach</i> while
in this realm of existence.
</p>

<p>
To think that the term "Master" denotes
what is actually denoted by the term
"Sage" is dangerous because it may
result in the false notion that a Jedi
is permitted to case working <i>toward</i>
Sagehood upon becoming a Master.
In reality, no Jedi is <i>ever</i> permitted
to cease working toward Sagehood while in
this realm of existence.
