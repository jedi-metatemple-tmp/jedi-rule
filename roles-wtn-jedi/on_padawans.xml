Having gained a grasp on the basics taught
by the school, it is time for the Jedi to begin
gaining experience with these skills in a real-life
setting.
That said, the Jedi is not yet ready to wield
the skills unsupervised and unsheltered.
This is when the Jedi graduates from being an Initiate
and becomes a <vc>Padawan</vc>.
</p>

<p>
It is impossible to allow the Padawan to
gain the real-life experience needed at this stage
under the same level of supervision and sheltering
that Initiates are afforded -
yet Padawans also are not ready to set off on their own.
For this reason, a Padawan should be made an <vc>Apprentice</vc>
to a Knight or Master who will serve as zir <vc>Mentor</vc>
and provide the necessary guidance and care at this stage while
still making it possible to gain real-life experience as safely
as is realistically possible.
