<p>
There are various roles, positions that a
Jedi may have in the Jedi community, or
within their school or order.
These roles are not to be confused with
ranks.
While ranks may <i>correspond</i> with
these roles,
ranks themselves are an administrative
construct.
What must be discussed here, though, is
not the ranks, but the archetypes of those
positions.

<p>
If it be such that there be no other
distinction between the two subjects
then there is at least one distinction.
Rather than discussing here the
administrative and technical criteria
for being given a certain rank -
instead, here is to be discussed
what these positions <i>mean</i>,
restricting treatment of the <i>criteria</i>
to only when it is <i>relevent</i> to the
<i>meaning</i> of the position.
