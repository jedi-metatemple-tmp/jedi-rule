<p>
There are various roles, positions that a
Jedi may have in the Jedi community, or
within their school or order.
These roles are not to be confused with
ranks.
While ranks may indeed correspond with
these roles,
ranks themselves are an administrative
construct.
What must be discussed here, though, is
not the ranks, but the archetypes of those
positions.

<p>
If it be such that there be no other
distinction between the two subjects
then there is at least one distinction.
Rather than discussing here the
administrative and technical criteria
for being given a certain rank -
instead, here is to be discussed
what these positions mean,
restricting treatment of the criteria
to only when it is relevent to the
meaning of the position.
