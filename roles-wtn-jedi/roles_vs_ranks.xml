One distinction between these roles and the ranks that
some schools may designate that correspond to them is
that ranks, being administrative in function, have a
certain rigidity to them that the roles do not.
Yes - the roles are important and need not be taken
lightly - but they are also subject to
certain peculiarities that the ranks might not be.

<p>
For example - if one is to come to a school,
already trained in a set of skills that lie
outside those which the school teaches, but which
fit well as being part of the Jedi Arts - and
if this newcomer has the ability to teach these
skills to others -- then let this newcomer function
as a teacher, even a Master of that particular set of
skills - even if zie merely be an Initiate for all
other intents and purposes.
