A <vc>Functionary</vc> is a Jedi who fulfills
a necessary role in their respective Jedi
organization.
</p>

<p>
One possible role for a Functionary is being
on their organization's Council.
This must be noted because there is some
confusion here - as many believe that being
on a Council makes a Jedi a Master.
This is far from the truth.
While it is indeed preferable for a Jedi
organization to select Masters for their
councils when such is available, being on
a Council does not in and of itself make one
a Master. It merely makes one a Functionary.
Even in groups where "Master" is the honorary
title of all members of the Council, that is
a separate usage of the term "Master"
- an alternate usage that may be permitted
so long as this dangerous confusion can be
cleared up in the face of it's usage
-- but which should be discontinued if there
is no other way to prevent members of the
community, especially that organization, from
thinking that being on that Council makes
one a Master.
