<title>On Compassion</title>


<lcn>

<p>
Easy it is to have compassion for one who has never done wrong in your
eyes.
Slightly harder it is to for compassion for one who has crossed
you in one way or another.
Hardest of all is to have compassion for one whom you believe
has done something heinous - even more one who has done
countless heinous things.
</p>

<p>
Nonetheless, we must strive in our Jedi discipline to do
all of that - for the darkness that possessed the greatest
villains of history lusts to possess us as well -- and
it will succeed in doing so if our compassion is
reserved for those who do right in our eyes.

This, of course, does not mean that we must condone acts
of evil.
We must still take any appropriate action against
everything from extreme evil to minor mischief.
This merely means that we must take this action from a place of
compassion.
</p>

<p>
But surely we must avoid judging bad actions to be
good, or even benign, just because doing so would
make it easier to be compassionate toward the
one who committed such actions.
</p>

<p>
For this reason, we must train ourselves so that we
no longer see a condemnation of someone's actions,
even the resolve to make an appropriate response to
those actions as being in any way incompatible
with being compassionate toward that same
someone.
