<title>On Compassion</title>


<lcn stat = "notyet">

<p>A bit of a blurb here about how easy it is to show compassion
on those who never do anything wrong ---- but how when someone
does something wrong it's important to *both* show compassion
*and* condemn the misdeed --- and that the greater the misdeed
in question, the more mastery doing this will entail.</p>
