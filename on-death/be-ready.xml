<p>
So in every decision you make, bear the fragility
of this life in mind.
Remember, when taking ay action, that it could
be your last - and, when taking any inaction,
that it could be upon your last opportunity to act.
When talking with someone, don't just assume
that you can patch things up later
- as it is always possible that now is your final
exchange with that person.
Don't just leave your affairs in disarray
out of a confidence that you can set them in order
later - for death may come before you get around
to doing so.
Bearing all this in mind, you can make the decision
that will allow you to be best prepared
should death show up all of a sudden.
</p>

<p>
And do not cultivate a fear of dying - but realize
that the death of your present form is an inevitable
stage of existence.
This way, by the time it is your turn to abandon
your corporeal form and merge with the Force,
you will have realized the message of the Fifth Line
of the Jedi Mantra:
"There is no death, there is the Force."
Only this way can you embark on your next journey
without flinching.
