Of all that we have on loan from the Universe,
few things if any do we hold more dearly than our
individual lives as corporeal beings.
Yet that, too, is not truly ours, but merely
on loan from the Universe.
There is no question of &quot;if&quot; the
Universe will demand it back from you,
but only the question of &quot;when&quot;
- and the answer to that question is not known.
Even if you have had a premonition of the future
that reveals whether or not you are alive at a
given future-time, it is only a preview of what
might be.
The future is still not finalized.

<p>
Our death to this realm of existence could come
at any time - and very often it comes with little
notice, or even without any notice at all.
Nobody is guaranteed a tomorrow
in this life - and as Jedi, we are forbidden to
delude ourselves otherwise.
Rather, we must walk on constant awareness of the
fragility of this life -- aware that it could
end any year - any month - any week - any day - any
hour - any moment.
The only way to be ready when this death comes
is to constantly be ready - at all times.
