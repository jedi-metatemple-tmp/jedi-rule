<!-- For extended-text of this class, the "title" should specify the name of the commentator and nothing else. -->
<!-- This extended-text class is only for non-regular commentators. If a commentator turns out to be *regular*,
zie should be given a designated class called "cmt:<name>" with a "tmplt" field of "cmnt/<name>" in which the
string "<name>" is substituted-out by a unique string identifying that particular commentator. Such classes
designated to individual commentators (unlike the one for non-regualr commentators) must *not* call for a title
element - and all commentaries attributed to that commentator should be re-assigned to that class, and their
title-elements removed. -->
