There are three basic things one commits to when embarking on
the Jedi path,
which ultimately are one thing.
These are Jedi Study, Jedi Life, and Jedi Perseverance.
There are ultimately one thing because none of these three things
can be sound without the other two.
</p>

<p>
The commitment to Jedi Study means that the Jedi commits to
continually study the Jedi Code as well as the Jedi Arts.
The study of the Jedi Arts is to <i>especially</i> include the
<vc>Core Arts</vc>, which are key to the <i>discernment</i> of the Jedi Code,
but <i>also</i> to include the <vc>Peripheral Arts</vc> that a Jedi is
<i>also</i> obligated to study.
Through the commitment to Jedi Study, the Jedi commits to study all
these areas and be guided appropriately by the metatemple,
zir instructors, the respective Councils, by this Rule, and
by all other resources available, not the least of which is the Force
itself.
</p>

<p>
Also through commitment to Jedi Study, the Jedi commits that in these
areas of study, and any other areas that that Jedi might study,
zie will approach things with the open-mindedness prescribed by
the Jedi Code - that is, to not allow zir views to be dictated
by inertia <i>or</i> by enthusiasm, but to properly scrutinize
any evidence pertaining to any view, and to amend the the view if
need-be.

<p>
The commitment to Jedi Study requires a Jedi to study
both the Core Arts <i>and</i> the Peripheral Arts.
But it also needs to be said that the distinction between
these two is not sudden and crisp, but a gradual continuum.
Most, if not all Jedi Arts, will have <i>some</i> role in
discernment of the Jedi Code - just some more
centrally than others.
It is <i>all</i> the Jedi Arts that a Jedi is required
to study as opportunity allows.
