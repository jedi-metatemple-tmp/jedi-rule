The commitment to Jedi Perseverance means that the Jedi commits,
in the event of failure, to integrate that failure into
zir study and zir life by learning whatever lessons
are to be taught by that failure and using those lessons
to strengthen zir walk along the Jedi path.
Through the commitment to Jedi Perseverance,
the Jedi commits to do this upon every failure,
no matter now many times zie fails along the path -
and to steer away from seeing these failures as
sources of discouragement by instead treating them
as sources of wisdom.

I also thing it is important that the commitment
to Jedi Perseverance <i>also</i> hold a Jedi from 
up-and-abandoning the metatemple  - but any language
to <i>that</i> effect
will be <i>especially</i> in need of abuse-proofing.
</p>

<p>
You see - the metatemple can't <i>survive</i> if members
just up-and-abandon it willy-nilly -- yet on the <i>other</i>
hand, if things go off-the-deep-end in the metatemple,
and means of resolving things <i>within</i> the structure
of the metatemple are absent, exhausted, or particularly
<i>dangerous</i>, then Jedi will <i>need</i> the last-resort
option of bolting.
This can even be the case if the metatemple refuses or fails to
correct a moral blind-spot that renders things particularly
<i>toxic</i> for that particular Jedi.
</p>

<p>
So the question is --- how can the language be developed
in such a way that the Jedi can be in good conscience
(i.e., not in violation of zir commitment) if zie
bolts when it truly <i>is</i> necessary --- but <i>not</i>
when such bolting is done <i>prematurely</i>.
</p>

<p>
Also - circumstances that compel a Jedi to depart do
<i>not</i> <i>release</i> that Jedi from zir commitments.
They merely permit the Jedi to separate from a
toxic metatemple while <i>fulfilling</i> those commitments.
This Rule is, after all, Open Source.
