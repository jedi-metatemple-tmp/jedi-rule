One more subject that should seem obvious
that would only it go without saying -
yet so many misconceptions in this area
exist that it is nonetheless necessary
to discuss the subject of proper attire
for a Jedi.
While it is true that the appropriate
Jedi attire does in fact reflect the
minimalism and utility inherent to
the Jedi goal of a simple life, it does
not do it by symbolically showcasing
these virtues - but rather, by the fact that
these principles are taken into account when
determining what to wear just as in any other
decision a Jedi makes.

<p>
As such, it would be a mistake to assume that
minimalism will in every case manifest as
the Jedi wearing the plainest garb -- as well
as to assume that utility means carrying the
most gadgets that could possibly be carried
in one's clothes.
