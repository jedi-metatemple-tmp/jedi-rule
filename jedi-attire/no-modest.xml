One of the most insidious misconceptions is
that a Jedi is to dress according to a principle
of modesty.
This view, frankly, has no basis in Jedi philosophy
whatsoever.
Of course, there <i>can</i> be situations in which
a Jedi finds it <i>useful</i> in one way or another
to dress modestly -
whether it is a Consular finding such garb
most useful for diplomacy in a certain situation -
or merely that that particular Jedi feels more
<i>comfortable</i> when dressed modestly
for <i>whatever</i> reasons of that Jedi's personal
background.
However, on <i>no</i> account is that a <i>general</i>
guiding principle of Jedi attire.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, those who <i>do</i> promote modest dress
as a <i>principle</i> generally do so with reasoning that is
patently incompatible with Jedi philosophy.
Such arguments generally assume that through how one
person (generally a female) dresses she is responsible
for the conduct of <i>another</i> person (generally a male).
Such arguments can not be accepted by a Jedi.
For one thing, they ask the Jedi who wears the clothes
to assume responsibility for someone else's actions --
even though we, as Jedi, know that someone else's actions
are not in our locus of control.
Furthermore, if the one deemed to be <i>responding</i>
to such clothing choices happens to <i>also</i>
be a Jedi, such an argument would be sending
an inherently un-Jedi message that that person
may justify zir actions or lack thereof based
on what someone <i>else</i> is wearing.
</p>

<p>
Therefore - the argument used to defend modest dress
as a <i>principle</i> undermines the very <i>foundation</i>
of what allows us Jedi to be protected from the Dark Side!
If a Jedi <i>does</i> choose to dress modestly, may zie
make <i>certain</i> that it is not on the basis of such
a vile and destructive rationale!
