One of the most insidious misconceptions is
that a Jedi is to dress according to a principle
of modesty.
This view, frankly, has no basis in Jedi philosophy
whatsoever.
Of course, there can indeed be situations in which
a Jedi finds it useful in one way or another
to dress modestly -
whether it is a Consular finding such garb
most useful for diplomacy in a certain situation -
or merely that that particular Jedi feels more
comfortable when dressed modestly
for whatever reasons of that Jedi's personal
background.
However, on no account is modesty itself a general
guiding principle of Jedi attire.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, those who do promote modest dress
as a matter of principle generally do so with reasoning that is
patently incompatible with Jedi philosophy.
Such arguments generally assume that through how one
person (generally a female) dresses she is responsible
for the conduct of another person (generally a male).
Such arguments can not be accepted by a Jedi.
For one thing, they ask the Jedi who wears the clothes
to assume responsibility for someone else's actions --
even though we, as Jedi, know that someone else's actions
are not in our locus of control.
Furthermore, if the one deemed to be responding
to such clothing choices happens to also
be a Jedi, such an argument would be sending
an inherently un-Jedi message that that person
may justify zir actions or lack thereof based
on what someone else is wearing.
</p>

<p>
Therefore - the argument used to defend modest dress
as a principle undermines the very foundation
of what allows us Jedi to be protected from the Dark Side!
If a Jedi does choose to dress modestly, may zie
make certain that it is not on the basis of such
a vile and destructive rationale!
