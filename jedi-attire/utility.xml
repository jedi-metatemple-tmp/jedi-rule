The principle of utility in the garb appropriate to
a Jedi is that a Jedi wears whatever is most <i>useful</i>
for zimself - specifically what is most useful
for zimself as a Jedi.
There can be great variety in what <i>exact</i> clothing
choices come from this - as there are many factors
influencing this - such as climate, the Jedi's physical form,
and even what task the Jedi needs to do <i>while</i>
wearing such clothes.

<p>
But the diversity goes even <i>further</i> in that it is
not just the <i>physical</i> utility that is to be taken
into account, but <i>psychological</i> utility as well.
Therefore, the different <i>personalities</i> of different
Jedi can <i>also</i> affect what is needed of a Jedi's
attire to optimize that Jedi's psychological wellness
and fitness as a Jedi.
