The principle of utility in the garb appropriate to
a Jedi is that a Jedi wears whatever is most useful
for zimself - specifically what is most useful
for zimself as a Jedi.
There can be great variety in what exact clothing
choices come from this - as there are many factors
influencing this - such as climate, the Jedi's physical form,
and even what task the Jedi needs to do while
wearing such clothes.

But the diversity goes even further in that it is
not just the physical utility that is to be taken
into account, but psychological utility as well.
Therefore, the different personalities of different
Jedi can also affect what is needed of a Jedi's
attire to optimize that Jedi's psychological wellness
and fitness as a Jedi.
