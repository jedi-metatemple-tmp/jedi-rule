As for simplicity in clothing - the same is true.
A Jedi does not dress in a manner that is extravagant
- yet not everything that on first-glance would <i>appear</i>
to be extravagant actually <i>is</i>.
Whether it is a piece of jewelry,
adornment of the face with make-up,
or even an extra frill on the garment
- though some people would consider
all these things to be frivolities,
as Jedi we know that the purpose and the manner
for which these are worn can make a huge difference.

<p>
While it is true that it is incompatible
with the Jedi path to wear such extra items
for the purpose of showing off
or anything shallow like that, there <i>are</i>
purposes for which a Jedi <i>can</i> wear them.
For one thing - some of these things may have
a legitimate utilitarian purpose - even if it isn't
apparent at first-glance.
This could be a hard-utilitarian purpose,
or be helpful to the Jedi's emotional well-being.
Also what might seem to <i>some</i> to be a frivolity might
in <i>actuality</i> be an outer artistic expression
of the Jedi's inner-self.
And even if such an extra item is only worn
out of sentiment, there is nothing wrong with that -
provided that the Jedi is mindful of the fact that
it is still an object, and as such on-loan from
the Universe that has the right to reclaim it at
any time.
