<title>On the Technical Council</title>

<lcn>

<p>
Let the metatemple establish a Technical Council,
so as to aid the member temples in setting up and using
their technology in a way that maximizes their participation
in the metatemple - and, in general, maximizes
their effectiveness as Jedi temples.
</p>

<p>
Let this Technical Council be an appropriate size for
dealing with the heaviest workload that can be reasonably
foreseen given the size of the metatemple,
whether that means that it have one memer or several members.
Should the number of Jedi in the metatemple qualified to
serve on the Technical Council be fewer than the number
required, or should that even be close to happening,
let apprentice members also be assigned
to the Technical Council.
</p>

<p>
Also, just as the Technical Council takes on apprentice
members for the training of new technical advisors,
let the full members of the Council likewise
train one another so that each become a more well-rounded
technical advisor.
</p>

<p>
To this end, should one member of the Technical Council
call upon another due to inability to confidently resolve
a specific issue, let not the first be dismissed to work
on another case or to do something else.
Rather, let the first stick around and even continue
actively participating in the case, so that learning
be derived from having to call upon another.
As a matter of fact, if possible,
let the second not even take over the
case from the first, but rather, let the second guide
the first through resolving the case zirself.
As the second line of the Jedi Mantra goes: "There is
no ignorance, there is knowledge".
</p>

<p>
And should a member of the Technical Council be in doubt
as to whether or not to call another - let zim be reminded
not to see weakness in not already being certain of the
answer - but rather to see strength in the eagerness
to learn - as well as strength in the commitment
to verifying that you are resolving the case as well as
you hope that you are doing.
</p>

<p>
And woe unto the technical advisor who latches hastily on to a
pet-theory regarding a case and ignores facts or input
to the contrary of this pet-theory - or who even fails
to properly check these factors!
In general such unwillingness to amend
one's views does not behoove a Jedi -
yet the hasty formation of views with such
inflexibility is an especially egregious
violation of the Jedi Code - not to mention the
potential detriment it can cause with regard to
proper resolution of the case at hand.
Let anyone who behaves in such a rash
and arrogant manner be
appropriately disciplined!
