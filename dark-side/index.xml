<title>On the Dark Side</title>

<lcn>

<p>
There are, of course, no two separate entities known as
the "Light Side of the Force" and the "Dark
Side of the Force". No - there is only
the Force. The Dark Side of the Force is
a reference to the darker <i>inclinations</i>
of the Force -- the potential for
<i>corruption</i> in the Force.
</p>

<p>
This corruption is what happens when
the Force is accessed through the darker
emotions of fear, anger, hate - even
pain.
To avoid falling to the dark side - one
must learn how to dispel and dissipate
these darker emotions without channeling
them into the Force -
and also how to access the Force without
resorting to use of these darker emotions
in doing so.

<p>
The one who has a hot temper does <i>not</i>
run as high a risk of turning to the Dark Side
as the one who denies their responsibility
to get a <i>grip</i> on their temper.
So if anyone in the metatemple claims that zir
temper is not serious enough to warrant the effort
of mastering it, remind zim of this.
</p>

<p>
And if someone in the metatemple objects to
doing zir part to control zir temper on the basis
that that's just how zie is -- remind zim that
inborn traits that predispose someone to temper
are a birth condition, and trauma in the past
that makes the temper more unruly are a circumstance
- but refusing to do what one <i>aught</i> to do
in effort to <i>control</i> it is a <i>choice</i>,
and that therefore one may be rightly held
accountable for it.
