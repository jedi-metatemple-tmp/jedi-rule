<title>On the Dark Side</title>

<lcn>

<p>
There are no two separate entities known as
the "Light Side of the Force" and the "Dark
Side of the Force". No - there is only
the Force. The Dark Side of the Force is
a reference to the darker <i>inclinations</i>
of the Force -- the potential for
<i>corruption</i> in the Force.
</p>

<p>
This corruption is what happens when
the Force is accessed through the darker
emotions of fear, anger, hate - even
pain.
To avoid falling to the dark side - one
must learn how to dispel and dissipate
these darker emotions without channeling
them into the Force -
and also how to access the Force without
resorting to use of these darker emotions
in doing so.

<p>
The one who has a hot temper does <i>not</i>
run as high a risk of turning to the Dark Side
as the one who denies their responsibility
to get a <i>grip</i> on their temper.
