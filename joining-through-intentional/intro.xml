<p>
Of course, in the event that an applicant seeks
to move into an intentional temple while joining
the metatemple, that is somewhat different than
that when that applicant seeks to bring zir own
residence with zim into the metatemple as a
grassroot temple.
For one thing, it is not only the Prime Council
of the metatemple that must be involved in the
decision-making process, but also
the Temple Council governing that temple.
Also, what must be taken into account is not
only the applicant's fitness and readiness to be a part
of the metatemple, but also
that applicant's compatibility with that specific temple.
Furthermore, the standard duration for the second
phase of the preparation period may be set to
a longer period of time for an intentional temple
than for grassroot temples.

<p>
As for the housing of the applicant during the
preparation period - the applicant must not
be allowed to live in the temple during the first
phase -- though in some situations, if guest quarters
are available, the Council may elect to allow zim
to remain there
- but even this should only be allowed when
necessary.
</p>


<p>
During the second phase of the preparation period,
the ideal is for the applicant to live in an area of
the temple separate from those who have been fully
initiated.
However, in situations where this is not practical,
let the Council - that being the Prime Council and the
Temple Council working together - work out what
needs to be done instead.
