Then there are the Fluffy Bunnies.
They differ from the deluded
near-gamers in that their ways of
expressing concepts do not come as
exclusively from the <dcn>Star Wars</dcn>
franchise, but rather, borrow just as
freely from other sources, overtly-fictional
and otherwise.
However, they are just as notorious for
failing to check everything they add
against reality.
Among faux Jedi, those of
this kind are especially
weak in the area of critical thinking.
They simply go with everything that feels
right to them, everything that
resonates with them, and call that
"Jedi".
</p>

<p>
If any of their views are
challenged, they may follow any of a
number of strategies to deflect
this correction.
Many will assert that you are
brainwashed by "the Man" or by "the Liberal
Media" or by "the Illuminati" or any of
a number of bogey-figures.
In reality, though, it is they
who are brainwashed by means of their
own inability or unwillingness to
think critically.

Others will prematurely fall on a
protocol that whose proper use is only
applied to actual unknowns which can
not be proven one way or the other
-- remaining headstrong in their
weak views, insisting that the only
prudent option is to "agree to disagree",
and suggesting that you lack civility
for refusing to see their counterfactual,
potentially-harmful view as being
equally legitimate.
</p>

<p>
While such protocol is
very much appropriate
for views that can neither be proven
nor disproven,
they do not rightly apply
to views that are demonstrably
false and baseless.
The only acceptance
you are obligated to give views that
so clearly fail the test of sanity is
to accept that it is beyond your power
to compel the holder of these views
to come to the table of reason.
