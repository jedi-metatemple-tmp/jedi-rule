Of course, there are many
other pitfalls as well - and
you must always bear in mind
that while much diversity exists
within the Jedi path, not everyone
who calls zimself a Jedi is in
fact a Jedi.
Rather, there are a number of ways
in which one may be deluded into
thinking that zie is a Jedi while
in reality, zie is on a path that
strays quite significantly from that
of the Jedi.

While it may be impossible, or at
last impractical,
to describe every form of faux
Jedi that may exist,
let us at least discuss some of
the most noteworthy forms.
