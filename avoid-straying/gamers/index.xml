Of course, there are many
other pitfalls as well - and
you must always bear in mind
that while much diversity exists
within the Jedi path, not everyone
who calls zimself a Jedi is in
fact a Jedi.
Rather, there are a number of ways
in which one may be deluded into
thinking that zie is a Jedi while
in reality, zie is on a path that
strays quite significantly from that
of the Jedi.

<p>
While it may be impossible, or at
last impractical,
to describe every form of faux
Jedi that may exist,
let us at least discuss some of
the most noteworthy forms.
</p>

<p>
First are those who are
little more than the players
of RPGs, that is, role-playing games.
Of course, true RPG gamers are aware
that it is their character in a game
that is a Jedi,
while they themselves are not.
They are aware of this,
whether their game is played with dice
over a tabletop or in a live-action
arena.
However, the faux Jedi who are closely
related to the RPG gamers lack
this full cognizance.
They take things literally from
gaming manuals, and even fictional
<dcn>Star Wars</dcn> media and
run with the assumption
that those things are real.
</p>

<p>
A true Jedi Realist might also
express reality in terms that
are borrowed from such fictional media,
even the term "Jedi" being one such
example.
However, a true Jedi will put everything
so borrowed through the filter and
the crucible of real-life experience,
which is one of the things that
puts the "Realism" in "Jedi Realism".
The faux Jedi of this variety do no
such thing.
