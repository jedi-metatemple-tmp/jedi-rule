Then there are the Martial Arts Blockheads.
They determine Jedi training in a manner
that equates the Jedi path
exclusively with Martial Arts.
This is clearly a deviation from the Jedi Path
because, while Martial Arts is in fact an area
of the Jedi Arts that no Jedi should squander
an opportunity to train in,
it is niether the sole area of the Jedi Arts
nor the core of the Jedi path.
Needless to say - one who studies the Martial
Arts to the exclusion of all else,
especially to the exclusion of the Jedi Code,
is no Jedi at all.

Also, while Martial Arts is an area of the
Jedi Arts that the Jedi Code forbids us to
willfully neglect,
it is a distortion of the Jedi Code
to censure or to diminish
those who are lacking in their Martial
Arts training for wont of adequate
opportunity.
