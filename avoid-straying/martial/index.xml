Then there are the Martial Arts Blockheads.
They determine Jedi training in a manner
that assumes that equates the Jedi path
exclusively with Martial Arts.
This is clearly a deviation from the Jedi Path
because, while Martial Arts is in fact an area
of the Jedi Arts that no Jedi should squander
an opportunity to train in,
it is niether the sole area of the Jedi Arts
nor the <i>core</i> of the Jedi path.
Needless to say - one who studies the Martial
Arts to the exclusion of all else,
especially to the exclusion of the Jedi Code,
is no Jedi at all.

Also, while Martial Arts is an area of the
Jedi Arts that the Jedi Code forbids us to
<i>willfully</i> neglect,
there is a <i>distortion</i> of the Jedi Code
that censure or diminish
those who are lacking in their Martial
Arts training for wont of adequate
<i>opportunity</i>.
