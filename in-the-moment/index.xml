<title>On Living in the Moment</title>


<lcn>

<p>
Remember Yoda's observation about Luke Skywalker -
how he was always obsessed, fixated on the future
that he was headed toward to the point of neglecting
the moment that he was in at the present.
Even in his dealings up to that point with the
Jedi Master on Degobah, Luke's fixation on
where he was off to was an issue ---
constantly obsessed with his search for the
mysterious Yoda to the point that it never
occurred to him to ask the little green fellow
in front of him what his name was.
</p>

<p>
Had Luke bothered to ask the little green
creature his name -- he might have answered
right there and then that his name was "Yoda",
and Luke would have realized that he had found
the Jedi Master he sought.
</p>

<p>
Being obsessed with where you are going to the
point of total neglect of the moment you are in
right there and then can cause all kinds of
disasters -- from not knowing when you have
reached your destination - to not seeing the
clearest path to your destination even if you
<i>haven't</i> reached it.
