<p>"Try not. Do - or do not. There is no try." -- Master Yoda</p>

<p>
Oh - so often we have this tendency to assume things are impossible without
good reason to reach this conclusion.
In these situations, of course, we have ourselves firmly convinced that
our reasons for naysaying the possibility are in fact true.
</p>

<p>
Indeed there exist things that truly are impossible.
But let us not underestimate how many things that are not truly
impossible yet are nonetheless <i>rendered</i> impossible merely
by our insistence that they <i>are</i> impossible.
</p>

<p>
In these cases, to say "I will try" is merely code for "I will
make a gesture of trying so as to prove my point that it can
not be done". That is not truly trying. That is not-doing disguised
as trying -- and in those situations, the only alternative to this
not-doing is to do.
</p>

<p>
When you try, try in earnest. Otherwise, do not bother
trying at all - for half-trying is a total waste.
