<title>On Simple Living</title>

<lcn>

<p>
It is part of the Jedi Code to live simply
and keep only that which you prize highly.
<cite>SW: Radio-SW: Ep5: Jedi that Was - Jedi to Be</cite>
The freedom from clutter that comes from such simple
living is part of what the Fourth Line of the Jedi Mantra
is referring to when it says: "There is no chaos, there is harmony."
</p>

<p>
All that said - while for some people, living
simply like this comes naturally - for many
it is easier said than done.

<p>Seriously -- some advice is needed on how to achieve this simplicity
for those for whom it cometh not naturally.</p>
