<title>On Simple Living</title>

<lcn>

<p>
It is part of the Jedi Code to live simply
and keep only that which you prize highly.
<cite>SW: Radio-SW: Ep5: Jedi that Was - Jedi to Be</cite>
The freedom from clutter that comes from such simple
living is part of what the Fourth Line of the Jedi Mantra
is referring to when it says: "There is no chaos, there is harmony."
</p>

<p>
All that said - while for some people, living
simply like this comes naturally - for many
it is easier said than done.

<p>
Lucky are those for whom such simplicity comes naturally - but
they are rare.
Even those who's hoarded items are fewer than that of
most people might still be clinging to stuff that isn't
of any true value to them.
</p>

<p>
The key is to practice mindfulness of your possessions.
Specifically, this means mindfulness as to your reason for keeping
them.
This could possibly involve going through any possession
you are tempted to keep. Reflect on your motive
for keeping it until it is either clear to you that
the item truly is of value and why it is so
- or until
you no longer feel the need to hold onto it,
and possibly even are to the point that your
separation from it will not only be painless but also liberating.
