# jedi-rule
XML source for an Introductory Rule for Jedi Realists

The home-page of this Rule is at: [http://metatemple.org/jedi-rule]

The main Git repisotiry is at: [https://github.com/jedi-metatemple/jedi-rule.git]

The expendable bleeding-edge Git repisotiry is at: [https://github.com/jedi-metatemple-tmp/jedi-rule.git]

Why two public Git repositories? This is because not every change to the Rule that is _considered_ is going to end up being _incorporated_. However, we don't want rejected changes to permanently bloat the size of the repository. For this reason, changes that are merely under _consideration_ are only made to the _expendable_ _bleeding-edge_ repository - and will not get transferred to the _main_ repository until the changes are _finalized_.

The bleeding-edge is said to be "expendable" in the sense that, occasionally, to clean out the gunk left by rejected changes, it may occasionally be _deleted_ and _re-cloned_ from the _main_ repository.
