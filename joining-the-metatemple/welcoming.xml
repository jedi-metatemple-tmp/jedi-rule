<p>
Once the Council is satisfied that the applicant is
fit and ready to be part of the metatemple,
let the new member of the metatemple be added
to the interior network and introduced
to the <i>rest</i> of the metatemple.
Yet even at this point, the new member may not
be allowed to take lifetime vows, but may
at first continue renewing them monthly.
When zie is ready, zie may transition to
renewing for three month periods,
for full years, and even three-year periods.
Only when zie is <i>certain</i>, after
<i>extensive</i> discernment,
may anyone be permitted to make lifetime vows.
