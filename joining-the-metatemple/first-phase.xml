<p>
Traditionally, the most time-honored method for formalizing
such commitments is through vows.
Such vows can also be a key part of the glue that holds
a metatemple together.
Yet these vows mustn't be taken lightly, but only after
proper discernment to assure that they are meant
with integrity.
</p>

<p>
To this end, new applicants seeking to be part of the
metatemple must not be immediately given full membership.
Rather, let every applicant undergo a period of preparation
with the close consultation and guidance of the
Primary Council,
which in some occasions <i>within</i> this period of preparation
may be represented by a duly designated subset thereof.
</p>

<p>
During this period of preparation, it is the duty of the Council
to see that the applicant is familiar with this Rule, and in
<i>general</i> with at least the <i>basics</i> of what being a
Jedi and being part of a metatemple entail.
It is also the time for the Council to be assured that the
applicant is serious about being part or the metatemple
and is ready for zir residence to be a Jedi temple - or at
least zir <i>part</i> of the residence in the event that zie
shares zir residence with non-Jedi.
